# Final-Project-602

## **INTRODUCTION**
In this notebook I'm going to perform a classification problem on AirBnb dataset.My motivation to choose airbnb as the performing dataset was because of the properties that are varied and interesting, there are large amount of observations, and the relevance to the subject. Each row in the "Listings" dataframe represents an Airbnb listing, which includes details about the property as well as statistics about the host.

This Project's aim was to:
* *Predict the type of host (superhosts/non-superhosts) and understanding what attributes contribute to the classification of a superhost*


### **DataSet** 

The data has been taken from 4 files as listed below. The datasets have been taken from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

* Listings 
* Reviews 
* Calendar
* Neighborhood
